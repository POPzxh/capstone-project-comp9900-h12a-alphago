Week 1
We set up a group. Then discussed the theme and needs we wanted to do. As a frontend developer I start to learn the framework we used.

Week 2
We have a meeting to discuss the project details like the website design and database schema. And I start to init a Springboot project and keep learning. Meanwhile, the proposal is on the way, I was responsible to draw the interface and flow diagram.
