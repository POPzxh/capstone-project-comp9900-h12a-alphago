Week1 

We formed a group. I met other team members and join the Jira account. Moreover,
I started to thinking about our responsiblity in the team and our role. Also, we 
checked and disscuss all of the project options and made a final decision: onlinePropertySale.
Under the leadership of Wanchao, we decided our softwares and technologies we gonna use.


Week2 

I joined a meeting with other team members. We disuccssed about the design of the tables, and for relationship 
database we decided to use MySQL. It's community has lots of support and detailed documents, so we can have less
difficulities when developing. Furthrmore, I met our backend team and know each other.


Week3

Working on our proposal and learning some new features about Sprint Boot. It is a powerful tool and has a lot of 
micro-services. So I spent some time and dive into it. Hopefully we can start to code our backend and then we can 
test some init functionalities like log in, log out or expire a user.
